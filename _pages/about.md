Wei Han is now a research scientist working on LLM Reasoning.

His research interests include multimdoal learning, semi-supervised learning, meta learning and relation extraction in Natural Language Processing (NLP). For more information, you can check this [CV](https://Clement25.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Collaborations are always welcome! If you are looking forward to research experience or trying academic projects with me, feel free to drop me an email (better to attach your CV or personal website so that I can get to know you well). 

<span style="color: red;"> I am actively seeking research scientist/engineer positions starting in 2025 based in Singapore/China/U.S (no particular preference). Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my profile and my skill set meets the position requirements! </span>
